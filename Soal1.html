        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a <br>
        document written in a markup language such as HTML. <s>CSS is a cornerstone technology of<br>
         the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</s></center></td>

            <font size="20">C</font>SS is designed to enable the separation of <br>
            presentation and content, including layout, colors,<br>
             and fonts. This separation can improve content <br>
              accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in <br>
               the specification of presentation characteristics,<br>
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by <br>
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file<br>
                 which reduces complexity and repetition in the<br>
                  structural content as well as enabling the .css file to <br>
                  be cached to improve the page load speed between <br>
                  the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in<br>
        <br>
         different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech- <br>
         <br>
         based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for<br>
         <br>
          alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</center></font><br>
